# The game with designed story
 
 I have already looked a program by python on a website which I have forgot now .In that project you can play a game by the function of 'print' in python .But if you want to change the story in side , you have to change from the code,which looks inconvenient and cannot be satisfied.
 In my project , you should get 3 text file ,which named as 'Content.txt','Structure.txt','Article.txt'.I gave you a simple example .
 some bug still need to be fixed .
